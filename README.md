## Introduction

This project is simply to provide structure to the data generated by the show and then use analysis on that data to provide insights into how the show works and any trends that exist. Such things are hopefully going to be predicted higher and lower offers to statistically best (and worst) names to have on the show.

## Dataset

The initial part of this project shall be to develop a dataset from which to work. This will involve developing a template of each entry of data - contestant, cash-builder-round, final-chase - and then to fill in this information, or find a method of doing so that is quick.

## Methods

This will be plotting methods or general statical methods that shall answer questions that one may have about the show. They can be built atop one another to obtain further information based on primary trends. A question may be the relationship of the number of correct answers in the final chase to the total cashbuilder value in situations that all four contestants beat their head-to-head. The idea being, to see if it is possible to correctly predict show outcomes, as a mere point of interest.
